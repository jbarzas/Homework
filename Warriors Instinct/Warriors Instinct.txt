Target demographic: Hardcore competitive for glory or casual just for fun players, the game will contain violence and blood/gore so it will need a mature rating.

Target platform: Windows, Mac, Consoles

A first person game heavily using physics driven animation to make striking something with a melee weapon feel like you are hitting something and not just tagging a target and causing it to lose health points. My end goal is to make a game that plays at as close to the speed of the players reaction time as possible with the only variables that effect your character's speed to act at the speed you input a command being your characters current amount of stamina and the gear set they choose.

Control Scheme


The way I logically see the game to be played is with a controller that has 2 joysticks(that are also a click button), 4 triggers/bumpers, 4 face buttons, and a D-pad.

I havent yet figured out how to bind all the functions to a keyboard and mouse in a way that it would feel as fluid as using a controller. This limits the player base to people who are on consoles or already own a controller for their computer that meets the requirements for the game.


To make your character attack you must press and hold the right trigger(for swinging attack) or the right bumper(for thrusting attack) and input a direction you want to attack from with the right joystick(looking joystick) then release it. If no direction was inputted then the attack will go directly to the center of your view. The longer you hold the attack button before release determines how strong the attack will be. 

To block an attack you must press and hold the left trigger(to block), then input the direction you want to block in. If you match the direction of an incoming attack if will be a perfect block, which causes the attacker to be staggered. If the direction of the block is within a short distance of attack direction it will be a normal block, which causes the attacker and defender to be staggered. If no direction was inputted then the block will be in the center and it will be a quick block, which causes the defender to be staggered.

The character creation screen include the choices of race, weapon, armor, and equipment items.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
It also includes an overall stats sections which shows important details to help you determine what race and gear to choose to fit your playstyle.

Weight - Shows the total amount of weight your character has equipped.

Speed - Determines how fast your character can move and sprint. 

Defense Rating - Determines the average amount of force reduction your character has and how resistant it is to being staggered.

________________________________________________________________________________________
The game will include a variety of 7 races each with its own specific ability and hitbox.


The Dwarf's ability is called "Stoneform". When the ability button is pressed it will cause your character to become immune to being staggered and take less damage for a set duration when it ends your character will lose all stamina, then goes on cooldown for a set duration.

The Elves ability is called "Blink". When the ability button is pressed it instantly teleports your character a set distance in the direction the camera is facing, the player may change the direction of it without changing the cameras facing by first holding the ability button and inputing a movement direction as you release the ability button, if there is something physically between you and the destination you will be placed on the otherside of the object, then go on cooldown for a set duration.
 
The Feline's ability is called "Pounce". When the ability button is pressed the character will quickly leap forward in the direction the camera is facing a set distance, or until you come in contact with a physical object, if your character contacts another character it will automatically swing an increased speed heavy attack that will always stagger at no stamina cost, then go on cooldown for a set duration, this ability can be blocked to stop the damage, but will still cause stagger.

The Human's ability is called "Resourcefulness". This increases the effectiveness of equipment items(damage, duration, area of effect, distance, etc.) and gives your character a second equipment item slot that is used by pressing the ability button.

The Reptilian's ability is called "Camouflage". When the ability button is pressed your character will become see through(similar to the stealth of the predators in AVP movies) until the player either attacks, blocks, uses an item, or the set duration is up, the slower you move the harder you are to see, becoming completely invisible while stationary(you can still look around with the camera without canceling this effect), then it goes on cooldown for a set duration.

The Minotaur's ability is called "Trampling Rush". When the ability button is pressed the character will become immune to being staggered and swiftly charge foward with reduced turning radius for a set duration or your character contacts a physical object, if your character contacts another character it will knock them down for a short duration, then goes on cooldown for a set duration, this ability can be blocked, but it will still knockdown. 

The Ursan's ability is called "Primal Rage". When the ability button is pressed it will cause all of your character's attacks to stagger and deal more damage for a set duration when it ends you will lose all stamina, then goes on cooldown for a set duration.
